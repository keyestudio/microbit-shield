**Description**

Keyestudio SK6812 4X8 LED dot matrix shield comes with 32 SK6812 LED lights,
fully compatible with micro bit control board. Onboard comes with two 3.3V
regulator chips, one powers for the micro bit control board, the other powers
for 32 SK6812 LED lights.

When using it, just input DC 5-9V to the shield. You can upload the control code
to the micro bit control board, then insert the micro bit into the shield, and
supply DC5-9V power voltage on the shield, this way you can control 32 SK6812
LED lights to display multiple colors.

**Specification**

-   Voltage Supply: DC 5-9V

-   The number of SK6812 LED: 32

**Features of SK6812 LED:**

1.  **Brightness:** R: 400-500MCD; G:1000-1500MCD; B: 300-400MCD

2.  **Band:** R: 620-625NM; G: 520-522.5NM; B: 467.5-470NM

3.  The 5050 built-in SK6812 light bead has intelligent reverse connection
    protection, so don’t worry about IC damage due to the reverse connection of
    power supply.

4.  The SK6812IC control circuit shares a common power supply with the LED light
    point source.

5.  The control circuit and RGB chip are integrated in a 5050 package component,
    forming a complete external control pixel.

6.  Built-in signal shaping circuit. After receiving the signal, any pixel point
    will access to waveform shaping and then output. Ensure that the waveform
    distortion of the circuit will not be accumulated.

7.  Built-in power-on reset and power-down reset circuit.

8.  The three primary colors of each pixel can realize 256-level brightness
    display, to complete the full color display of 16777216 kinds of colors. The
    scanning frequency is not lower than 400Hz/s.

9.  Serial cascade interface. Able to complete the data receiving and decoding
    through a signal line.

10. Any two-point transmission distance does not need to add any circuit when
    the distance does not exceed 5 meters.

11. When the refresh rate is 30 frames/second, the number of cascades is not
    less than 1024 points.

12. Data transmission speed can reach up to 800Kbps.

13. The color of light is highly consistent and cost-effective.

**How to test it ?**

This SK6812 4x8 LED dot matrix shield should be used together with micro:bit
main board.

**What you will see ?**

Upload well the code to the micro:bit control board, then insert the micro:bit
into shield, and supply the power DC 5-9V, finally you will see the LEDs on the
shield display shiny colors. Shown below.

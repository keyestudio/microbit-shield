## Description

Micro：bit , a microcontroller of ARM structure designed by BBC, is designed for
those who love to learn programming. It supports the PXT graphical programming
interface developed by Microsoft. You don’t need to download additional
compilers. It can be used under Windows, macOS, IOS, Android and other systems.

To take advantage of the driver DC motor, we designed this expansion board. The
board integrates 3.3V and 5V voltage regulator chips, serial communication
interface for connecting BT modules and a DRV8833CPWP chip which outputs the
maximum 700mA currentIt also has four motor control modes: clockwise
rotation/anticlockwise rotation/boot/stop. PWM supports frequencies up to 100
kHz.

This board also has 3-pin interfaces which can be connected to other sensors.

**The motor pin A1, A2, B2 and B1 of the expansion board are controlled by P13,
P12, P15 and P16 of the micro:bit board.**

## 5. Test Result

Wire up, upload the code and power on. Two motors rotate clockwise for 3s and
anticlockwise for 3s.

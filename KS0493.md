**Description**

This shield is fully compatible with micro bit control board. It comes with 3
AAA batteries, SK6812-P4 RGB LED and 4 3pin ports with 2.54mm pitch.

Fix battery holder with 2M3\*6MM flat screws and 2 M3 nuts, place 3 AAA
batteries inside, and install the micro bit control board on the mini servo car
shield with 5 M3\*6MM screws.

When the right DIP switch on the shield is dialed to the ON end, the battery box
supplies power, when dialed to the OFF side, the power can’t be provided.

When the left DIP switch is dialed to RGB end, the micro: bit control board can
control the color of 5 SK6812-P4 RGB LEDs by code. Moreover, the 3pins port at
the pxl-bxt can connect SK6812-P4 RGB LED modules and control their colors；when
set to SERVO end, micro：bit can regulate the angles of 3 external servos
connected to 3pin ports of SERVO1 SERVO2 SERVO.

**Test Results**

After uploading the code successfully, wire the devices well. Set the right DIP
switch to the ON side and the left DIP switch to the RGB side, 5 SK6812-P4 RGB
LEDs display alternately the corresponding colors; when the left DIP switch set
to the SERVO end, 3 external servos swing from 0 to 90 ° alternatively.
